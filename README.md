# ECIO-RGB

A simple module for simple animations on ECIO devices, common in gaming laptops (often as internal led strips)

This project relies on ECIO.dll, SPARKIO.dll, and SPARKIO.sys that i do not own rights to distribution and can't include in repository (probably)

You can find them in your device control panel folders. (Evoo Control Center, Monster Kontrol Merkezi, etc)

Not meant to be run directly. Most useful for audio mode.
